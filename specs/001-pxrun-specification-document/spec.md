## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A developer working from their laptop needs to quickly create temporary LXC containers on a remote Proxmox cluster for testing purposes. They want to reduce the complexity from multiple manual steps to a single command, with the ability to save and reuse configurations for common development patterns.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer with access to a Proxmox cluster, **When** they run the tool for the first time, **Then** they can create a basic Debian container with minimal inputs (< 6 prompts) in under 2 minutes

2. **Given** a developer has created a container configuration, **When** they want to create similar containers, **Then** they can save the configuration to YAML and reuse it with optional overrides

3. **Given** a developer needs hardware acceleration for media processing, **When** they create a container, **Then** they can enable QSV/hardware access with proper device permissions automatically configured

4. **Given** a developer has finished testing, **When** they want to clean up, **Then** they can destroy containers by ID with a single command

5. **Given** a developer accesses Proxmox via HTTPS reverse proxy, **When** they use the tool, **Then** all operations work correctly over high-latency connections

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Proxmox API is unavailable or times out?
- How does system handle when requested resources exceed cluster capacity?
- What occurs when multiple users try to allocate the same VMID simultaneously?
- How does the tool behave when network provisioning commands fail inside the container?
- What happens when a template is not available on the selected node?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Container Management
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create LXC containers on remote Proxmox clusters
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to destroy LXC containers by container ID
- **FR-003**: System MUST list existing containers for user selection
- **FR-004**: System MUST display available templates from the cluster
- **FR-005**: System MUST support operation across multi-node clusters (minimum 2 nodes)

#### Configuration & Reproducibility
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow saving container configurations to YAML format
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow loading configurations from saved YAML files
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow overriding specific configuration values when loading from YAML
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide sensible defaults for all optional parameters
- **FR-010**: System MUST use individual YAML configuration files for each container configuration

#### Container Provisioning
- **FR-011**: System MUST support automatic provisioning of common development tools
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle Docker installation in containers
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle Tailscale installation with authentication key support
- **FR-014**: System MUST support hardware acceleration enablement (QSV/device passthrough)
- **FR-015**: System MUST configure mount points for host directory access
- **FR-016**: System MUST provision containers via SSH connection to Proxmox node using pct exec commands

#### Operational Requirements
- **FR-017**: System MUST complete basic container creation in < 60 seconds (excluding template download)
- **FR-018**: System MUST require < 6 user inputs for basic container creation
- **FR-019**: System MUST work reliably over HTTPS reverse proxy connections
- **FR-020**: System MUST handle high-latency network connections gracefully
- **FR-021**: System MUST remain stateless, querying Proxmox for current state
- **FR-022**: System MUST provide dry-run capability for operations
- **FR-023**: System MUST validate all inputs before making API calls
- **FR-024**: System MUST provide clear, actionable error messages
- **FR-025**: System MUST display connection information clearly after container creation

#### Security Requirements
- **FR-026**: System MUST support API token authentication (preferred over passwords)
- **FR-027**: System MUST NOT store credentials in configuration files (use environment variables)
- **FR-028**: System MUST NOT expose credentials in process arguments or logs
- **FR-029**: System MUST handle authentication token refresh appropriately

#### User Interface Requirements
- **FR-030**: System MUST use sequential inline prompts for user interaction (SSH-compatible)
- **FR-031**: System MUST maintain < 200ms response time for local operations
- **FR-032**: System MUST provide copy-paste friendly output for connection details
- **FR-033**: System MUST document mount point syntax clearly
- **FR-034**: System MUST use default resources of 2 CPU cores, 1GB memory, and 10GB storage when not specified
- **FR-035**: System MUST prompt user to select target node from available nodes, with optional --node flag for override

### Key Entities

- **Container Configuration**: Represents all settings needed to create an LXC container including resources (CPU, memory, storage), network settings, mount points, and provisioning scripts

- **Container Template**: Pre-built OS images available on Proxmox nodes that serve as the base for new containers (e.g., Debian 13, Ubuntu 24.04)

- **Cluster Node**: Individual Proxmox server in the cluster where containers can be created and run

- **Storage Pool**: Named storage location on cluster nodes where container root filesystems and data are stored

- **Mount Point**: Mapping between host directories and container paths for shared file access

- **Provisioning Script**: Commands or scripts executed after container creation to install software and configure the environment

## Resolved Decisions

### 1. User Interface Paradigm
**Decision**: Sequential inline prompts
**Rationale**: Ensures excellent SSH compatibility and keeps implementation simple, which is critical for the primary use case of remote management from developer laptops.

### 2. Configuration Management Strategy
**Decision**: Individual YAML files per container
**Rationale**: Provides a simple mental model that's easy to understand, share, and version control. Each configuration is self-contained without complex inheritance chains.

### 3. Provisioning Method
**Decision**: SSH-based provisioning via Proxmox node
**Rationale**: Given Proxmox API limitations (no direct exec endpoint for LXC), SSH to the node and using pct exec commands provides the most reliable provisioning path.

### 4. Default Resources
**Decision**: 2 CPU cores, 1GB memory, 10GB storage
**Rationale**: Conservative defaults that work for most development scenarios without overwhelming cluster resources.

### 5. Node Selection
**Decision**: User selection with --node flag override
**Rationale**: Gives users control over placement while allowing automation via command-line flag when needed.

### 6. Scope Boundaries
**Decision**: Focus on core create/destroy operations
**Rationale**: Maintain tool focus on the "spin up and tear down" workflow. Additional features (start/stop, status display, config export, resource modification) are deferred to keep initial implementation focused.
